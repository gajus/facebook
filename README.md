The Facebook SDK for PHP provides an interface to the Graph API. The main difference between the [official PHP SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk-v4) and Fuss is the API.

## Reinventing the Wheel

The original [facebook/facebook-php-sdk](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk) is lacking separation of concerns. The [facebook/facebook-php-sdk-v4](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk-v4) is a big step forward. Nonetheless, it came with its own evils that I could not live with (e.g. use of stateful programming and globals). The API itself is designed to cover all uses cases, which is expected of the official SDK, though not necessary needed for an average Facebook app. Fuss is trading some of the functionality in favor of a more intuitive API.

I am looking forward to hearing feedback either via gk@anuary.com or in the [issues](https://github.com/gajus/fuss/issues) section.

## Fuss.js

[Fuss.js](https://github.com/gajus/fuss.js) is an extension of Fuss. It is designed for handling Facebook user authorization.

## Everything Together

The following example is meant to cover the most common use scenario for Fuss. If you need further guidance, this document contains description of every Fuss SDK use-case and method.

```php
/**
 * @param int $app_id App ID.
 * @param string $app_secret App secret.
 */
$app = new Gajus\Fuss\App(123, 'abc');
$user = null;

$signed_request = $app->getSignedRequest();

if ($signed_request) {
    $access_token = $signed_request->getAccessToken();

    if ($access_token) {
        if (!$access_token->isLong()) {
            $access_token->extend();
        }

        $user = new Gajus\Fuss\User($access_token);
    }
}

if ($user) {
    $request = new Gajus\Fuss\Request($user, 'GET', 'me', ['fields' => 'first_name']);
    $response = $request->make();

    // $response['first_name']
}
```

## Initializing App

> You will need to have configured a Facebook App, which you can obtain from the [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

Initialize the SDK with your app ID and secret:

```php
/**
 * @param string $app_id App ID.
 * @param string $app_secret App secret.
 * @param array $options
 */
$app = new Gajus\Fuss\App('your app ID', 'your app secret');
```

> In the original Facebook PHP SDK, [`FacebookSession::setDefaultApplication`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/php/gettingstarted/4.0.0#init) is used to set the default app credentials statically, making them accessible for future calls without needing to reference an equivalent of the `Gajus\Fuss\App` instance.

### Options

The options are accepted at the time of constructing the app:

```php
$app = new Gajus\Fuss\App('your app ID', 'your app secret', [
    Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_VERSION => 'v2.1',
    Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_FORCE_COOKIE => true
]);
```

#### `Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_VERSION`

This option specifies the default version of the Graph API to use, e.g.

```php
$app = new Gajus\Fuss\App('your app ID', 'your app secret', [
    Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_VERSION => 'v2.1'
]);

$request = new Gajus\Fuss\Request($app, 'GET', 'app');
```

The above will produce a request against `https://graph.facebook.com/v2.1/app` URL.

You can overwrite the default version at the time of making a request:

```php
$app = new Gajus\Fuss\App('your app ID', 'your app secret', [
    Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_VERSION => 'v2.1'
]);

$request = new Gajus\Fuss\Request($app, 'GET', 'v2.0/app');
```

Excluding the version from the request path and not setting the `Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_VERSION` will make all request URLs version-less, e.g.

```php
$app = new Gajus\Fuss\App('your app ID', 'your app secret');

$request = new Gajus\Fuss\Request($app, 'GET', 'app');
```

The above will produce a request against `https://graph.facebook.com/app` URL.

#### `Gajus\Fuss\App::OPTION_FORCE_COOKIE` (experimental)

If enabled (default is disabled), Fuss SDK will attempt to set a cookie on clients that have explicitly opted not to accept third-party cookies. This is done by redirecting the user to the domain that needs to set the cookie and then redirecting user back to the Facebook Page Tab or Canvas URL. For more details, see the [original issue](https://github.com/gajus/fuss/issues/2).

## Get the Signed Request

The [signed request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/signed-request/) is encapsulated in the `Gajus\Fuss\SignedRequest` entity. It is available via an instance of `App` when either of the following is true:

* The signed request was received via the `$_POST['signed_request']`.
* The signed request is present in the user session.
* The signed request is present in the JavaScript SDK cookie.

```php
/**
 * @return null|Gajus\Fuss\SignedRequest
 */
$signed_request = $app->getSignedRequest();
```

You might have obtained the signed request via the JavaScript SDK (e.g. [FB.getLoginStatus](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.getLoginStatus#response_and_session_objects)). In which case, you can share it with the app:

```php
/**
 * Designed to be used for a signed request retrieved via the JavaScript SDK.
 * 
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.getLoginStatus#response_and_session_objects
 * @param string $signed_request
 * @return null
 */
$app->setSignedRequest('the signed request');
```

The sign request is stored in the user session and can be retrieved on the following request.

### Signed Request Data

A signed request contains some additional fields of information, even before permissions have been requested:

```php
/**
 * User ID when user access token is in or can be derived from the signed request.
 *
 * @return null|int
 */
$signed_request->getUserId();

/**
 * The content of the app_data query string parameter which may be passed if the app is being loaded within a Page Tab.
 * The JSON input is automatically decoded.
 * 
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/signed-request/
 * @return mixed
 */
$signed_request->getAppData();

/**
 * Return the signed request payload.
 * 
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/signed-request/
 * @return array
 */
$signed_request->getPayload();
```

## Get the User Access Token

The `Gajus\Fuss\AccessToken` is available when either of the following is true:

* The signed request had the `access_token`.
* The signed request had `code` that has been exchanged for the access token.

```php
/**
 * Resolve the user access token from the signed request.
 * The access token is either provided or it can be exchanged for the code.
 *
 * @return null|Gajus\Fuss\AccessToken
 */
$access_token = $signed_request->getAccessToken();
```

You can build an `AccessToken` if you have it (e.g. stored in the database):

```php
/**
 * @param Gajus\Fuss\App $app
 * @param string $access_token A string that identifies a user, app, or page and can be used by the app to make graph API calls.
 * @param self::TYPE_USER|self::TYPE_APP|self::TYPE_PAGE $type
 */
$access_token = new Gajus\Fuss\AccessToken($app, 'user access token', Gajus\Fuss\AccessToken::TYPE_USER);
```

### Extend The Access Token

Access tokens generated via web login are [short-lived](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens#termtokens) tokens, but you can upgrade them to long-lived tokens.

To check if the access token is long-lived:

```php
/**
 * The issued_at field is not returned for short-lived access tokens.
 * 
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens#debug
 * @return boolean
 */
$access_token->isLong();
```

To extend a short-lived access token:

```php
/**
 * Extend a short-lived access token for a long-lived access token.
 * Upon successfully extending the token, the instance of the object
 * is updated with the long-lived access token.
 *
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens#extending
 * @return null
 */
$access_token->extend();
```

To know when does the access token expire:

```php
/**
 * @return int UNIX timestamp in seconds.
 */
$access_token->getExpirationTimestamp();
```

Take a string copy to store the access token for later use:

```php
/**
 * @return string The access token as a string.
 */
$access_token->getPlain();
```

## Initializing User

In order to make calls on behalf of a [user](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.1/user), you need to create `User` entity with a valid access token:

```php
/**
 * @param Gajus\Fuss\AccessToken $access_token
 */
$user = new Gajus\Fuss\User($access_token);
```

Upon instantiating the `User` object, the access token is used to fetch information about the user.

```php
/**
 * Get Facebook user ID.
 * Beware that as of Graph API v2.0, the user ID is app-scoped.
 *
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/upgrading#upgrading_v2_0_user_ids
 * @return null|int
 */
$user->getId();
```

You can update user access token:

```php
/**
 * @param Gajus\Fuss\AccessToken $access_token
 * @return null
 */
$user->setAccessToken($access_token);
```

## Making Graph API calls

An API call can be made using either `Gajus\Fuss\App` or `Gajus\Fuss\User` context. If use `App` context, then app access token is used; is use `User` context, then user access token is used.

```php
/**
 * @param Gajus\Fuss\Session $session
 * @param string $method GET|POST|DELETE
 * @param string $path Path relative to the Graph API.
 * @param array $query GET parameters.
 */
$request = new Gajus\Fuss\Request($app, 'GET', 'app');

/**
 * @throws Gajus\Fuss\RequestException If the Graph API call results in an error.
 * @return array Graph API response.
 */
$request->make();
```

## Page Tab

When an app is loaded in the [page tab](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/pagetabs), the signed request contains information about the page itself. This information is abstracted using the `PageTab` class:

```php
/**
 * Return PageTab when app is loaded in a page tab.
 * 
 * @return null|Gajus\Fuss\PageTab
 */
$page_tab = $signed_request->getPageTab();
```

The abstracted data is accessed via the following methods:

```php
/**
 * The page ID.
 * 
 * @return int
 */
$page_tab->getId();

/**
 * true if the loading user has liked the page, false if not.
 * 
 * @deprecated This field will no longer be included for any app created after the launch of v2.1 (August 7th, 2014), and will be permanently set to true for all other apps on November 5th, 2014.
 * @see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/signed-request
 * @return boolean
 */
$page_tab->isLiked();

/**
 * true if the loading user is an admin of the page.
 * 
 * @return boolean
 */
$page_tab->isAdmin();
```


## Installation

If you are using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) as a package manager, add the following dependency to the `composer.json` and run composer with the install parameter.

```
{
    "require" : {
        "gajus/fuss" : "2.0.*"
    }
}
```

## Tests

The tests are automatically run using the [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/gajus/fuss) and secured app credentials.

To run the tests locally,

1. Pull the repository using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
2. Create `tests/config.php` from `tests/config.php.dist` and edit to add your credentials.
3. Execute the test script using the [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/).

> You should be using a sandboxed application for running the tests.
